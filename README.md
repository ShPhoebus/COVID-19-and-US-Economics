# COVID-19-and-the-US-Economics
I have mastered common machine learning models and methods in Machine Learning Fund and Apps course, completing the final project that analyzed the relationship between COVID-19 and US economics and establishing an ML model to predict the future trend.

Research Questions:

1. What types of data/news from COVID-19 is a better predictor of the economy: Sentiment from Social Media Posts by People or Factual COVID-19 Statistics released by Verified Institutions?

2. Did less consumer movement/outdoor activity negatively affect the economy and the online shopping?

3. Can we use Consumer Movement to predict rates of COVID-19 transmission?
